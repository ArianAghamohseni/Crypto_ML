# Crypto_ML

A comprehensive cryptocurrency analysis project that leverages machine learning techniques, Python, and data science principles. The project is divided into three main parts:

Clustering Analysis: Explore the historical data of the top 4 cryptocurrencies over the past year. Visualize the data, perform K-means clustering, and identify meaningful clusters. Gain insights into market cap and trading volume trends.

Hierarchical Clustering: Extend the analysis to a broader set of cryptocurrencies by using hierarchical clustering. Understand the relationships between various cryptocurrencies based on market cap and volume, and visualize the results using dendrograms.

Price Prediction: Build machine learning models to predict whether the price of Monero (XMR) will increase or decrease on the next day. Utilize historical price data and various features to train and evaluate the model's performance.
